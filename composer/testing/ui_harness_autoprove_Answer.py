AUTO-GENERATED fake-LLM tape for the 'autoprove_Answer' AutoProve scenario.

Recorded by composer.testing.record_tape from a real run: each lane is the ordered
list of a phase's AIMessage responses (keyed by run_task task_id), serialized as
JSON and validated back into AIMessages on import. HarnessFakeLLM replays one per
llm.ainvoke. To curate, edit `_TAPE_JSON` (drop diverging turns, fix the tail, etc.).

Replay with the SAME CLI flags used to record:

        <system.md> --max-bug-rounds 1 [--interactive]
