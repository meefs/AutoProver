"""
Append-only event buffer consumed by the background drainer.

One ``EventQueue`` is created per ``with_handler()`` scope.  All
event sinks within that scope (one per ``run_graph()`` call) push
to the same queue.  A single ``_queue_drainer`` task consumes
events via ``stream_events()``.

The queue never blocks writers — ``push()`` is synchronous.  The
consumer blocks on an ``asyncio.Event`` until new items arrive.
