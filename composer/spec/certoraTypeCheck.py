"""
This is a wrapper script which sandboxes an invocation of run_certora.py
while still allowing access to the structured return type.

The structured data is returned via the first argument, which is a temp file
into which the serialized result is written (either None or a CertoraRunResult).

If certora run throws an exception, it is caught, and the serialized representation of the
exception is written to the same file.

All other arguments past the first are passed through to `run_certora`.
