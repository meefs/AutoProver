"""Shared base for run-scoped artifact writers.

Each workflow's ``ArtifactStore`` owns its own deliverable layout so the path
conventions live in one place rather than smeared across the pipeline. This base
hosts what is *identical* across workflows — the analysis-phase
``properties.json``, the ``{property title: [demonstrating names]}`` map,
``commentary.md``, and the run's ``token_usage.json`` — keyed off a per-component
``stem`` plus two abstract directories. The workflow-specific bundles (CVL
``.spec``/``.conf`` for the prover, ``.t.sol`` metadata for foundry) live in the
subclasses, which translate their domain objects into ``stem``s and call these
primitives.
