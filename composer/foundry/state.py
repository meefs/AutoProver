"""State types + completion gate for the foundry test author.

Mirrors ``composer/spec/cvl_generation.py`` for the foundry workflow:

* ``curr_test: str | None`` — the buffered ``.t.sol`` source. Single
  file, single buffer (per the design decision).
* ``expected_failures: dict[str, str]`` — test-name → reason map for tests
  intentionally expected to fail. Populated by ``expect_test_failure``,
  cleared per-key by ``expect_test_passage``. The ``forge_test`` runner
  excludes these from the all-green check.
* ``last_test_names`` — the test-function names reported by the most
  recent ``forge_test`` run (parsed from forge's JSON output). The runner
  records this unconditionally on every run that produced parseable
  results; the publish gate uses it to check the declared property→test
  mapping against the tests that *actually ran*, rather than trusting the
  agent's transcription.
* ``skipped`` / ``property_tests`` / ``validations`` / ``required_validations``
  — same shape as the CVL counterpart, just keyed against ``curr_test``
  for the digest. ``property_tests`` carries the property→test-function
  mapping enforced at publish time via ``validate_property_tests``.
