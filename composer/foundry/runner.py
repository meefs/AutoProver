"""``forge test`` runner — the foundry analog of ``spec/source/prover.py``.

Exposes ``ForgeTestTool`` (and a convenience ``get_forge_test_tool`` factory)
that:

* Reads ``curr_test`` from injected state.
* Stages it into ``<project_root>/test/_composer_draft_<key>.t.sol`` for
  the duration of one ``forge test`` run, then deletes the staged file.
  ``<key>`` is either the agent-supplied ``seed`` arg (stable across
  invocations — replays foundry's ``cache/fuzz`` failure persistence) or
  a fresh UUID (unique per run — no replay).
* Runs ``forge test --json --match-path test/<staged>`` so only the
  draft's tests run and the result comes back as structured JSON.
* On a fully green run (excluding tests marked via
  ``expect_test_failure``), stamps ``validations[FORGE_TEST_VALIDATION_KEY]``
  ONLY when the run was unseeded. Seeded runs are a debugging aid for
  iterating on specific fuzz/invariant counterexamples; a clean unseeded
  run is what certifies the property for publish.
* On any unexpected failure or output that doesn't parse as JSON,
  returns the raw output and leaves ``validations`` untouched.

The slice of forge's JSON output we consume is modeled by
``_ForgeSuiteResult`` / ``_ForgeTestEntry`` (see the JSON-parsing section
below); shape stable across recent forge versions. Output that is JSON
but does not validate against that schema raises — see
``_parse_forge_json`` for the rationale.

    Run the project's foundry test suite against your current draft.

    The current ``curr_test`` buffer is written into
    ``<project_root>/test/`` as a ``.t.sol`` file, then
    ``forge test --json --match-path test/<that>`` runs.

    ``seed`` controls the staged filename. If you provide a seed, the
    file is staged at ``test/_composer_draft_<seed>.t.sol`` — the SAME
    path across invocations — so foundry's ``cache/fuzz`` persistence
    finds prior failing inputs and replays them first. This is how you
    iterate on a specific fuzz / invariant counterexample.

    If you omit ``seed``, the file is staged under a fresh UUID — a path
    foundry has never seen, so the persistence cache misses and the
    fuzzer runs a brand-new campaign with no carryover.

    The publish gate is ONLY stamped by an unseeded (no-``seed``) run.
    A seeded run is a debugging aid; a clean unseeded run is the
    certification. The intended loop is:

    1. Author / revise tests, call ``forge_test`` without ``seed``.
    2. If something fails, call ``forge_test(seed="x")`` repeatedly with
       the SAME ``seed`` to zero in on the counterexample (each replays
       the cached failing inputs first, so progress on the specific bug
       is monotonic).
    3. Once the seeded run is clean, call ``forge_test`` once more
       without ``seed`` to stamp the publish gate.
