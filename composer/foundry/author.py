"""Foundry test author — generates ``.t.sol`` tests for property formulations.

The single home for the foundry authoring workflow: the author's tools, the
feedback judge, the publish gate, and the batch entry point
(``batch_foundry_test_generation``). The ``forge test`` runner lives in
``composer.foundry.runner``; state types and the publish-gate checks live in
``composer.foundry.state``.

Workflow shape:

* Single ``curr_test: str`` buffer per batch (one ``.t.sol`` file), written
  via ``put_test_raw``. No put-time compile check; ``forge_test`` is the gate.
* A feedback judge (``feedback_tool``) reviews the draft against the batch's
  properties. Publish requires both a green unseeded ``forge_test`` run AND a
  judge acceptance stamped on the *current* buffer.
* The publish-time property→test mapping is validated against the test names
  forge actually ran (from its JSON output), in both directions: every
  non-skipped property is demonstrated by a test that ran, and every test
  that ran is tied back to a property.
* Per-test expected-failure marking via ``expect_test_failure``.
* No prover-config editor — foundry projects are assumed pre-configured.

You are approaching the context limit for your task. After this point your
context will be cleared and the task restarted from the initial prompt.

To enable you to continue effectively, summarize the current state of your
task. In particular, summarize:
1. The current state of your test draft (high-level structure, which
   properties you have formalized, which you have skipped and why).
2. Which test functions verify which properties (the property→test mapping
   you intend to declare at publish).
3. Any tests you have marked as expected-to-fail and why.
4. Any unresolved feedback — from the last ``forge_test`` run (compile
   errors, failing tests, etc.) or from the feedback judge — that you still
   need to address.
5. Foundry cheatcode patterns / idioms you discovered during this batch
   so the next iteration does not re-research them.

If your current task itself began with a summary, include the salient parts
of that summary in your new summary.

You are resuming this task already in progress. The current version of your
test draft (if any) is available via the ``get_test`` tool.

A summary of your work up to this point:

BEGIN SUMMARY:
{summary}
END SUMMARY

**IMPORTANT**: Nothing has changed since the summary was produced. You do
NOT need to re-research foundry cheatcode patterns already captured in the
summary. If you have outstanding ``forge_test`` failures or judge feedback to
address, proceed directly with addressing them.

    Caller responsibilities:

    * ``project_root`` is a fully-configured foundry project (has
      ``foundry.toml`` and any required deps under ``lib/``). The author
      stages its draft into ``<project_root>/test/`` and deletes the
      staged file after each ``forge test`` invocation.
    * ``env`` carries the foundry RAG (``rag_tools``) + project source
      tools (``source_tools``). Typically built via
      ``composer.foundry.env.build_foundry_env``.
    * ``contract_name`` / ``component`` / ``props`` are bound into the
      initial prompt (``foundry_property_generation_prompt.j2``).

    ``ctx`` is marked ``FoundryGeneration`` so its cache namespace stays
    distinct from a co-located CVL run's.
